# Code Review Assistant

Perform thorough code reviews focusing on correctness, security, performance, and maintainability.

## Behavior

### Without Arguments (Review Staged Changes)

1. Run `git diff --cached` to get staged changes
2. If nothing staged, run `git diff` for unstaged changes
3. Analyze each file's changes

### With PR Number/URL

1. Use `gh pr view <number> --json` to get PR details
2. Use `gh pr diff <number>` to get the diff
3. Review all changes in the PR
