# Implement - Execute Task Plan

Execute tasks from the plan, track progress, and enable session continuation.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check Current State

**FIRST:** Determine what state we're in:

```
1. Check for uncommitted changes (git status)
2. Check for plan files (.ai-factory/PLAN.md or branch-named)
3. Check current branch
```

**If uncommitted changes exist:**
```
You have uncommitted changes. Commit them first?
- [ ] Yes, commit now (/ai-factory.commit)
- [ ] No, stash and continue
- [ ] Cancel
```

**If NO plan file exists (all tasks completed or fresh start):**

```
No active plan found.

Current branch: feature/user-auth

What would you like to do?
- [ ] Start new feature from current branch
- [ ] Return to main/master and start new feature
- [ ] Create quick task plan (no branch)
- [ ] Nothing, just checking status
```

Based on choice:
- New feature from current → `/ai-factory.feature <description>`
- Return to main → `git checkout main && git pull` → `/ai-factory.feature <description>`
- Quick task → `/ai-factory.task <description>`

**If plan file exists → continue to Step 0.1**

### Step 0.1: Load Project Context & Past Experience

**Read `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`** if it exists to understand:
- Tech stack (language, framework, database, ORM)
- Project architecture and conventions
- Non-functional requirements

**Read all patches from `.ai-factory/patches/`** if the directory exists:
- Use `Glob` to find all `*.md` files in `.ai-factory/patches/`
- Read each patch to learn from past fixes and mistakes
- Apply lessons learned: avoid patterns that caused bugs, use patterns that prevented them
- Pay attention to **Root Cause** and **Prevention** sections — they tell you what NOT to do

**Use this context when implementing:**
- Follow the specified tech stack
- Use correct import patterns and conventions
- Apply proper error handling and logging as specified
- **Avoid pitfalls documented in patches** — don't repeat past mistakes

### Step 0.1: Find Plan File

**Check for plan files in this order:**

```
1. .ai-factory/PLAN.md exists? → Use it (direct /task call)
2. No .ai-factory/PLAN.md → Check current git branch:
   git branch --show-current
   → Look for .ai-factory/features/<branch-name>.md (e.g., .ai-factory/features/feature-user-auth.md)
```

**Priority:**
1. `.ai-factory/PLAN.md` - always takes priority (from direct `/ai-factory.task`)
2. Branch-named file - if no .ai-factory/PLAN.md (from `/ai-factory.feature`)

**Read the plan file** to understand:
- Context and settings (testing, logging preferences)
- Commit checkpoints (when to commit)
- Task dependencies

### Step 1: Load Current State

```
TaskList → Get all tasks with status
```

Find:
- Next pending task (not blocked, not completed)
- Any in_progress tasks (resume these first)

### Step 2: Display Progress

```
## Implementation Progress

✅ Completed: 3/8 tasks
🔄 In Progress: Task #4 - Implement search service
⏳ Pending: 4 tasks

Current task: #4 - Implement search service
```

### Step 3: Execute Current Task

For each task:

**3.1: Fetch full details**
```
TaskGet(taskId) → Get description, files, context
```

**3.2: Mark as in_progress**
```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "in_progress")
```

**3.3: Implement the task**
- Read relevant files
- Make necessary changes
- Follow existing code patterns
- **NO tests unless plan includes test tasks**
- **NO reports or summaries**

**3.4: Verify implementation**
- Check code compiles/runs
- Verify functionality works
- Fix any immediate issues

**3.5: Mark as completed**
```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "completed")
```

**3.6: Update checkbox in plan file**

**IMMEDIATELY** after completing a task, update the checkbox in the plan file:

```markdown
# Before
- [ ] Task 1: Create user model

# After
- [x] Task 1: Create user model
```

**This is MANDATORY** — checkboxes must reflect actual progress:
- Use `Edit` tool to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Do this RIGHT AFTER each task completion
- Even if deletion will be offered later
- Plan file is the source of truth for progress

**3.7: Update .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md if needed**

If during implementation:
- New dependency/library was added
- Tech stack changed (e.g., added Redis, switched ORM)
- New integration added (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid)
- Architecture decision was made

→ Update `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` to reflect the change:

```markdown
## Tech Stack
- **Cache:** Redis (added for session storage)
```

This keeps .ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md as the source of truth.

**3.8: Check for commit checkpoint**

If the plan has commit checkpoints and current task is at a checkpoint:
```
✅ Tasks 1-4 completed.

This is a commit checkpoint. Ready to commit?
Suggested message: "feat: add base models and types"

- [ ] Yes, commit now (/ai-factory.commit)
- [ ] No, continue to next task
- [ ] Skip all commit checkpoints
```

**3.9: Move to next task or pause**

### Step 4: Session Persistence

Progress is automatically saved via TaskUpdate.

**To pause:**
```
Current progress saved.

Completed: 4/8 tasks
Next task: #5 - Add pagination support

To resume later, run:
/ai-factory.implement
```

**To resume (next session):**
```
/ai-factory.implement
```
→ Automatically finds next incomplete task

### Step 5: Completion

When all tasks are done:

```
## Implementation Complete

All 8 tasks completed.

Branch: feature/product-search
Plan file: .ai-factory/features/feature-product-search.md
Files modified:
- src/services/search.ts (created)
- src/api/products/search.ts (created)
- src/types/search.ts (created)

Ready to commit? Use:
/ai-factory.commit
```

**Handle plan file after completion:**

- **If `.ai-factory/PLAN.md`** (direct /task, not from /feature):
  ```
  Would you like to delete .ai-factory/PLAN.md? (It's no longer needed)
  - [ ] Yes, delete it
  - [ ] No, keep it
  ```

- **If branch-named file** (e.g., `.ai-factory/features/feature-user-auth.md`):
  - Keep it - documents what was done
  - User can delete before merging if desired

**IMPORTANT: NO summary reports, NO analysis documents, NO wrap-up tasks.**

## Commands

### Start/Resume Implementation
```
/ai-factory.implement
```
Continues from next incomplete task.

### Start from Specific Task
```
/ai-factory.implement 5
```
Starts from task #5 (useful for skipping or re-doing).

### Check Status Only
```
/ai-factory.implement status
```
Shows progress without executing.

## Execution Rules

### DO:
- ✅ Execute one task at a time
- ✅ Mark tasks in_progress before starting
- ✅ Mark tasks completed after finishing
- ✅ Follow existing code conventions
- ✅ Create files mentioned in task description
- ✅ Handle edge cases mentioned in task
- ✅ Stop and ask if task is unclear

### DON'T:
- ❌ Write tests (unless explicitly in task list)
- ❌ Create report files
- ❌ Create summary documents
- ❌ Add tasks not in the plan
- ❌ Skip tasks without user permission
- ❌ Mark incomplete tasks as done

## Progress Display Format

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Feature: User Authentication                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✅ #1 Create user model                     │
│ ✅ #2 Add registration endpoint             │
│ ✅ #3 Add login endpoint                    │
│ 🔄 #4 Implement JWT generation    ← current │
│ ⏳ #5 Add password reset                    │
│ ⏳ #6 Add email verification                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Progress: 3/6 (50%)                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Handling Blockers

If a task cannot be completed:

```
⚠️ Blocker encountered on Task #4

Issue: [Description of the problem]

Options:
1. Skip this task and continue (mark as blocked)
2. Modify the task approach
3. Stop implementation and discuss

What would you like to do?
```

## Session Continuity

Tasks are persisted in the conversation/project state.

**Starting new session:**
```
User: /ai-factory.implement

Claude: Resuming implementation...

Found 3 completed tasks, 5 pending.
Continuing from Task #4: Implement JWT generation

[Executes task #4]
```

## Example Full Flow

```
Session 1:
  /ai-factory.feature Add user authentication
  → Creates branch: feature/user-authentication
  → Asks about tests (No), logging (Verbose)
  → /ai-factory.task creates 6 tasks
  → Saves plan to: .ai-factory/features/feature-user-authentication.md
  → /ai-factory.implement starts
  → Completes tasks #1, #2, #3
  → User ends session

Session 2:
  /ai-factory.implement
  → Detects branch: feature/user-authentication
  → Reads plan: .ai-factory/features/feature-user-authentication.md
  → Loads state: 3/6 complete
  → Continues from task #4
  → Completes tasks #4, #5, #6
  → All done, suggests /ai-factory.commit
```

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER write tests** unless task list explicitly includes test tasks
2. **NEVER create reports** or summary documents after completion
3. **ALWAYS mark task in_progress** before starting work
4. **ALWAYS mark task completed** after finishing
5. **ALWAYS update checkbox in plan file** - `- [ ]` → `- [x]` immediately after task completion
6. **PRESERVE progress** - tasks survive session boundaries
7. **ONE task at a time** - focus on current task only

## CRITICAL: Logging Requirements

**ALWAYS add verbose logging when implementing code.** AI-generated code often has subtle bugs that are hard to debug without proper logging.

### Logging Guidelines

1. **Log function entry/exit** with parameters and return values
2. **Log state changes** - before and after mutations
3. **Log external calls** - API requests, database queries, file operations
4. **Log error context** - include relevant variables, not just error message
5. **Use structured logging** when possible (JSON format)

### Example Pattern

```typescript
function processOrder(order: Order): Result {
  console.log('[processOrder] START', { orderId: order.id, items: order.items.length });

  try {
    const validated = validateOrder(order);
    console.log('[processOrder] Validation passed', { validated });

    const result = submitToPayment(validated);
    console.log('[processOrder] Payment result', { success: result.success, transactionId: result.id });

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[processOrder] ERROR', { orderId: order.id, error: error.message, stack: error.stack });
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Log Management Requirements

**Logs must be configurable and manageable:**

1. **Use log levels** - DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
2. **Environment-based control** - LOG_LEVEL env variable
3. **Easy to disable** - single flag or env var to turn off verbose logs
4. **Consider rotation** - for file-based logs, implement rotation or use existing tools

```typescript
// Good: Configurable logging
const LOG_LEVEL = process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'debug';
const logger = createLogger({ level: LOG_LEVEL });

// Good: Can be disabled
if (process.env.DEBUG) {
  console.log('[debug]', data);
}

// Bad: Hardcoded verbose logs that can't be turned off
console.log(hugeObject); // Will pollute production logs
```

### Why This Matters

- AI-generated code may have edge cases not covered
- Logs help identify WHERE things go wrong
- Debugging without logs wastes significant time
- User can remove logs later if needed, but missing logs during development is costly
- **Production safety** - logs must be reducible to avoid performance issues and storage costs

**DO NOT skip logging to "keep code clean" - verbose logging is REQUIRED during implementation, but MUST be configurable.**
